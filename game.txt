1. array with random words as the correct answer? array?
    -select a random word from array XXX
    
2. Create underscores - same length as the word 
      = variables
    - saving the underscores as a variable or as a array! 
    - decide how many lives with a let 
    - create a msg variable (empty value) 

["_", "_"]


        // While loop 3, 4 and 5 run it as long as msg is empty

3. need a prompt with userinput guessing different single letters? 
    - validate the userinput with regex "is it one single letter"  use it with a varbiable and if or while to check true/false
    - message if its not a single letter 
    - while loop to check if the letter is valid

4. Compare the userinput with the correct word with array.include
    - if statement
    - if its true replace an underscore with the letter - find the indexOf and change it - or for loop
    - what if its 2 letters? try later 
    - if its wrong show a msg 
    - create another array with "guessletters array" -- outside the if statement!
    - lives = lives-- (in the else part)


5. compare the underscores with the correct word 
    - if its true set msg "you win"
    - compare to see if lives > 0
    - if not set msg = "you loose"
    
    // while loop
    

    
    
    -display end message you win or you loose 
    









- compare if the input letter is correct? if-statement?

- wrong guess will remove the letter? how? 

- show number of lives remain? how?

- alert to show if win or lose
